## Greetings from Team GraffitiðŸ‘‹
We are just a small group of passionate people trying to make reusable open source hardware and software that gives it a soul. 

Currently what we are working on:
#### The Graffiti Machine 
It's just a simple hardware kit that anyone can use to make their own things like a DIY printer maybe? Or maybe some industrial machine for mass producing their product?
This is still under development and once we have a proper working model we are open sourcing the whole design including the CAD files and proper documentation.



regards
The Graffiti Team
